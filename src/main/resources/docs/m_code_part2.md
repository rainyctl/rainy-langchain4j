## M0051–M0100

The Anime Meme Knowledge Base API provides structured programmatic access to a curated set of widely recognized and
culturally relevant anime meme references.
Each meme entry is assigned a unique identifier code (e.g., M0001–M0100) and includes a human-readable slug along with a
concise description outlining its context, origin, and general usage within anime communities. The dataset is designed
to support efficient querying, indexing, browsing, and retrieval across applications, including knowledge systems, RAG
pipelines, educational resources, entertainment platforms, and cultural reference tools. This standardized format
ensures consistency, reliability, and ease of integration across diverse development and analytical environments.
